# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Streamlit & Deep Learning  

## 📝 Overview  
This project is a **Stock Price Predictor** built using **Streamlit** and **Deep Learning**. Given a stock name, the model predicts its future price based on historical data. The project leverages **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks)** for time-series forecasting and integrates **various Python libraries** for data visualization and analysis.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **User-friendly Streamlit Interface** 📊  
✅ **Deep Learning (LSTM) for Stock Price Forecasting**  
✅ **Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
✅ **Real-time Stock Data Fetching**  
✅ **Customizable Date Ranges for Predictions**
